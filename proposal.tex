\section{Our Proposal}
Though the M4 aggregation provides an error free visualization it has the following limitations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item It doesn't work with other data sources besides RDBMS
	\item It doesn't provide solution to map-reduce based big data frame works like Hadoop, spark etc.
	\item and it doesn't handle the data file system like CSV, JSON and most visualization systems take data directly from these file systems \cite{bostock2011d3}.
	\item It also doesn't provide solution for streaming data visualizations. But visualization of streaming time series data with appropriate reduction in data size is a crucial need of moder exploratory data analysis etc.
\end{enumerate}
