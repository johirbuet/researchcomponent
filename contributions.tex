\section{Controbutions of the paper}
The authors of the paper rewrite visualization queries $Q$ using data reduction operator 
$M_R$ such that the visualization of the original data from query $Q$ and the visualization 
from the query $Q_R = M_R(Q)$ are similar and error free. 
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{qr}
	\caption{Time series visualization: a) based on original data; b) Using data reduction operator;}   
	\label{fig:1}
\end{figure}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:1} $Q_R$ produced the same visualization as $Q$ with almost 10 times less tuples and 10 times reduced time.
