\subsection{M4 Aggregation}
M4 is a value preserving aggregation strategy for time series data.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{m4}

\end{figure}
It divides the entire time series dataset into $w$ equal groups and thus each pixel column in the visualization takes only one group.
