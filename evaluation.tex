\section{Evaluation}
The authors use three different real life time series data and evaluate their results with some existing state of the art data reduction approaches.
The authors use the following datasets:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item the price of a single
	share on the Frankfurt stock exchange over 6 weeks (700k
	tuples)
	\item 71 minutes from a speed sensor of a soccer ball
	\cite{mutschler2013debs}(ball number 8, 7M rows)
	\item one week of sensor data
	from an electrical power sensor of a semiconductor manufacturing
	machine \cite{jerzak2012debs}(sensor MF03, 55M rows)
\end{enumerate}
