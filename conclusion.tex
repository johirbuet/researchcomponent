\section{Conclusion}
We presented a review of the paper \cite{jugel2014m4}. The paper presents a technique of time series data reduction that provides error free visualization and higher time performance. The work is only suitable for visualization systems where the data source is 
a RDBMS. We also identified few limitations of this work and proposed some future research directions.
