\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
Visualization of large scale time series data is a crucial need of modern exploratory
bigdata analysis \cite{fu2011review}. But the huge size of the data is a barrier to visualization \cite{labrinidis2012challenges,fan2014challenges,chen2014data}. 
To address this challenge of bigdata different data reduction and sampling strategies are used to overcome the barrier \cite{cormode2014sampling,wu2014data}. But for preserving the 
semantics of trend line of time series data these sampling strategies show huge 
limitations \cite{jugel2014m4}. 

In this review paper we present a review of the paper \cite{jugel2014m4} which address this issue of preserving the semantic of time series data and present some related works in the line.  The paper appeared in the \textbf{Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2014}. 

The authors present M4, an aggregation based time series data reduction strategy that guarantees error free visualization of time series data as line chart as well as higher rate of data reduction. The approach is generic to any visualization system as long as the visualization systems uses RDBMS as data source.
