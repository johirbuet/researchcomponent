\section{Introduction} \label{intro}
Visualization of large scale time series data is a crucial need of modern exploratory
bigdata analysis \cite{fu2011review}. But the huge size of the data is a barrier to visualization \cite{labrinidis2012challenges,fan2014challenges,chen2014data}. 
In this review paper we present a review of the paper \cite{jugel2014m4} and present some related works in the line.  The paper appeared in the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment, 2014.
